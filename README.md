# Parkour Game Backend API Server

### Setup:
1. Clone the repo.
2. Setup a virtual environment for the repo in python 3.6 with the command:  
`virtualenv --python=python3.6 parkourBackend`  
(do this one directory level above the repo to ensure virtualenv is in root of parkourBackend).
3. run `source bin/activate` from within the parkourBackend directory to load the virtualenv.
4. run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies.
3. Begin coding and commit to a feature branch. Create a pull request from the feature branch to the base branch. Once approved this will be auto-deployed to AWS.
4. Access the API server from: [https://api.parkour.ultra-horizon.com](https://api.parkour.ultra-horizon.com)
